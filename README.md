ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James Bourne.
I've been in IT since the early 1990s, starting in programming and then taking a position as a Systems Administrator. 
 
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, roller derby, hiking, crypto currency, and making life better through technology. I'm also a believer
in creating natural spaces within urban areas to allow nature to exist in those places. To that end my partner and myself have
created such a space as we are fortunate enough to have our own place to do this in.
 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning better ways to implement devops in small environments. Lately I've been working towards more automation
within my companies' environment. I am always looking for better ways to do things.
